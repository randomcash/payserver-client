"""Every class the markup emits must have a rule somewhere.

This exists because a rename shipped without it. `btn-sm` became `ps-btn-sm`
across 69 call sites, the rule stayed behind as `.btn-sm`, and 104 buttons lost
their styling on testnet. Nothing caught it:

* the layout suite passes, because it asserts geometry, not colour or size
* the e2e suite passes, because it locates elements by class and the classes are
  all present - just unstyled
* checking that the stylesheet's selector set was preserved passes, because it
  was: the rules still exist, under names nothing renders any more

That last one is the trap. "No selector was lost" and "every emitted class is
styled" sound like the same check and are not. This is the second one.

It used to check only `ps-` classes, and that scoping cost something. The
plugin page rendered into `class="page"` - a class this stylesheet has never
defined - so it had no max width, no column, no gap and no heading while every
screen beside it had all three. Unprefixed, so nothing looked. Generalising it
turned up 78 more, including every class on the 404 page and the whole of
`LoadingState`, which renders two empty divs and a paragraph on the invoice
list and detail pages.

The old scoping was for a real reason - noise. Reading every double-quoted
string in a file finds "the", "and" and "you" and calls them classes. So this
reads only the values of `class=` attributes: the literal when the attribute is
one, and every literal in the expression when it is a conditional, which is how
`ps-btn-success` and `ps-btn-warning` stay covered. 510 classes, one false
positive.

What it cannot see is a class chosen by a function - `class=tone_class(tone)`
has no literal on the line. `plugin_page.rs` covers its own three such helpers
in a unit test, by calling them.

## The baseline

Generalising found 78 unstyled classes that predate it, on pages nobody is
changing today. Failing on all of them would mean either a red CI nobody can
fix in one sitting, or a check nobody turns on. So `classes-unstyled-baseline.txt`
records them, this fails on anything new, and it *also* fails when a baselined
class becomes styled without being removed from the list - so the list only
shrinks.

Usage: scripts/check-classes-styled.py   (exits non-zero on an unstyled class)
       scripts/check-classes-styled.py --update-baseline

    Two shapes, because Leptos writes both:

      class="a b"                       -> the literal
      class=if c { "a" } else { "b" }   -> both branches

    The second is why reading only the first literal after `class=` is not
    enough: that is how `ps-btn-warning` hid from an earlier version of this
    script. The first is why reading to the end of the line is too much: a line
    can carry `style="..."` and text content as well, and counting those finds
    470 "classes" where there are 510 real ones.
