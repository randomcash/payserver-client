# that need a real JS object graph (js_sys::Object / js_sys::Reflect) rather
# than a mocked EIP-1193 provider, so a plain `#[test]` can't reach them.
#
# None of these tests touch the DOM, so they run under Node.js rather than a
# headless browser - `wasm-bindgen-test`'s default when
# `wasm_bindgen_test_configure!(run_in_browser)` is not called. CI uses this
# same script so a local run and CI can't drift apart.
#
# Needs a recent Node - 18 crashes partway through the run (the runtime's glue
# JS uses a WASM externref feature Node 18's V8 doesn't have); Node 22, what
# the layout job already installs, works.
