//! The API types the client uses.
//!
//! Almost all of these now come from `api-types` in payserver-commons, which is
//! the same crate the server builds its responses from. That is the point: the
//! client used to keep its own hand-written copy of each shape, the two were
//! compiled separately, and nothing checked that they agreed. When they drifted
//! the whole workspace still built and the page died on contact with the API -
//! three times in one day.
//!
//! What stays here is what the server does not define: view models the client
//! assembles for itself, and the auth shapes that come from `ui-kit`.
//!
//! The aliases exist so pages keep reading `Invoice` rather than
//! `InvoiceResponse`. The shape is the server's; only the local name is shorter.
