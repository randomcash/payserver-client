# payserver-client

The merchant-facing frontend for the random.cash payservers. Leptos compiled to
WebAssembly, served by nginx, talking to whichever payserver is configured at
runtime.

**One client, any chain.** It must never depend on a payserver repository. The
API contract lives in `payserver-commons/api-types`, which both sides compile
against — that is the seam, and it is the reason this repo is separate.

## This repository is public

No session URLs in commits or PR bodies, no secrets. Also no ticket ids or
tracker links in source files — no `RCS-123`, no `linear.app` URL, anywhere in
code or comments. A ticket id here leaks the shape of unreleased work, and an
outside reader cannot open it anyway. Write the reason the code exists, not a
pointer to where someone once explained it; the ticket id belongs in the
commit message and PR title. `scripts/check-no-ticket-refs.sh` enforces this
in CI; `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` are exempt.

## It is compiled, which changes what a plugin or theme can be

There is no runtime template layer. Anything that renders is Rust compiled into
the bundle, so "let a plugin provide a page" cannot mean "load Rust into the
client". Keep that in mind before promising extensibility that the architecture
does not support.

## Every class the markup emits must have a rule

`scripts/check-classes-styled.py` enforces this in CI, and it exists because the
alternative shipped: a rename moved the markup to new class names, the rules
stayed behind under the old ones, and **104 buttons rendered unstyled on
testnet**. Nothing caught it —

- the layout suite asserts geometry, not colour or size, so an unstyled button of
  the same shape passes
- e2e locates elements by class, and every class was present, just carrying no
  rules
- comparing the stylesheet's selector set before and after showed nothing lost,
  which was true and irrelevant: the rules still existed, under names nothing
  renders any more

*"No selector was lost"* and *"every class the markup emits has a rule"* sound
like the same check. Only the second one catches this.

It checked only `ps-`-prefixed classes until 2026-09-20, and the scoping cost
something: a plugin page rendered into `class="page"`, which this stylesheet has
never defined, so it had no width, column, gap or heading while every screen
beside it had all four. Unprefixed, so nothing looked. Generalising it found 78
more — every class on the 404 page, and the whole of `LoadingState`, which
renders two empty divs and a paragraph on the invoice list and detail pages.

Those 78 are in `scripts/classes-unstyled-baseline.txt`. **It is meant to
shrink.** The check fails on a class that is not in it, and also on one that is
in it and has since been styled — a list that only grows stops meaning anything.
Never add to it to make a build pass; add the rule, or point the markup at a
class that has one.

What it cannot see is a class chosen by a function — `class=tone_class(tone)`
puts no literal on the line. `plugin_page.rs` covers its own three such helpers
in a unit test that *calls* them, which is the pattern to copy if you add
another.

## The design system is written down in tokens

There is one, and it is in `styles.css`. What to reach for before inventing
anything:

- **Tokens, not values.** `--space-*`, `--text-*`, `--border-radius-*`,
  `--shadow-*`, and the palette on `:root`. A hard-coded `12px` or `#635bff` in
  a new rule is a bug.
- **`ps-` is the current component vocabulary**, migrating from unprefixed
  legacy names. Where both exist they are *not* always the same: `ps-card` clips
  its children and `ps-card-header` styles its own `h3`; `card` does neither.
  Prefer `ps-`. `.btn` and `.ps-btn` are aliased and either is fine.
- **A page is `.ps-page`** — column, `--space-5` gap, `--content-max-width` —
  with a `.page-header-row` carrying `.page-title` and optionally
  `.page-description`. Several pages still spell the shell out for themselves;
  that is history, not a pattern to copy.
- **Status goes on the card header line**, opposite the title.
  `.ps-card-header` is a flex row with `justify-content: space-between` for
  exactly that.
- **Loading and error states are components** — `LoadingState`, `LoadingInline`,
  `ErrorState`, `EmptyState` in `components/feedback.rs` — not hand-rolled divs.

## Renaming a class is a cross-repo change

`ethpayserver`'s e2e suite locates elements by class, and tests against the
client image pinned in its `ops/client-image.pin`. So a rename here needs a
matching change there — **the selectors and the pin bump in one commit**, or
whoever bumps the pin next inherits failures they did not cause.

Check before renaming:

```bash
git grep -n "\.the-class" ../ethpayserver/e2e/
```

## Editing CSS with a script

Tempting, and it has gone wrong twice in one session. Comments in `styles.css`
mention class names in prose, so a regex that matches selectors will happily
splice a comment in half — producing a mangled rule that the browser discards
silently. One such mangle broke the rule pinning a `<select>` to the same height
as an `<input>`.

If you must, be comment-aware, and verify structurally afterwards: every selector
that existed before still exists, comment markers balance, braces balance.

## The gate

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
python3 scripts/check-classes-styled.py
```

CI additionally runs a Playwright layout suite and builds the wasm bundle.

## Commons is pinned by revision

`payserver-commons` is pinned by `rev`, so a change there is invisible here until
the pin moves. `scripts/commons.sh link` points the build at a local checkout for
development; **`scripts/commons.sh unlink` before verifying or committing**, or
you are testing your working copy rather than the pin. The lock file must never
be committed while linked.

## Conventions that bite

- **`git grep`, not bare `grep`** — `grep` is `ugrep` here and honours
  `.gitignore`.
- **Never `git add -A`** — check for strays and add paths explicitly.
- **A test that cannot fail is worse than no test.** Break the thing it covers
  and confirm it goes red.
